# Files for RAFT implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the RAFT consensus algorith from the repository [zhebrak/raftos](https://github.com/zhebrak/raftos.git).

I removed nearly all files with only the directory containing the .py files necessary to run the RAFT implementation. Along with a fixed version of requirements.txt for the dependencies.

Clone this into your project and make sure "raftos" direcotry is in the same folder as the executable that is calling all the functions.
